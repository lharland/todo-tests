In the root of the project, run the test using this:
npx playwright test --ui

The above command opens the GUI of playwright and click the Run all button above the test files.
It will also look for tests inside the tests/ folder.

Disclaimer: There is also a fully written file generated by Playwright in test-examples. 
But some of the locators are different.
